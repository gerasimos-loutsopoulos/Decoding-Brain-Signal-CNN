# Decoding-Brain-Signal-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)


This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using the Keras deep learning framework. The purpose of this network is to decode EEG data, specifically for object recognition tasks. The EEG data was collected from participants who viewed images belonging to six distinct categories: human body, human face, animal body, animal face, inanimate natural objects, and inanimate man-made objects. The test set included 72 images presented to participants, and the CNN aims to classify the category of the image a participant was viewing based on their recorded EEG signals.
